I have made this project with MVVM architecture. I have used Combine for Network Management and Combine for data binding from viewmodel to viewcontroller.

I divided project into two modules Currency Conversion module and Currency Selection Module.Currencies are being refreshed after 30 minutes as described in requirements and calculating selected currency rates offline.

All the code is developed to adhere Solid Principles.

I have written Some unit tests using XCTest.
